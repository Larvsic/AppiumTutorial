How to generate a Xpath from androidUIautomator

1.- Select something - it has details
2.- From the details - You can identify only by [package, class, resource-id, text, index] Core attributes
3.- Syntax is : //tagName[@attribute='value']
4.- tagName is : class attributes

Ex.

class - android.widget.Textview

text - Preferences

xpath would be : androidDriver.findElementByXPath("//android.widget.TextView[@text='Preference']");
